export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am Khushi Neema, a driven Data Scientist currently attending Northeastern University to complete my MS in Data Science in 2024. My academic trajectory in the field of computer science runs in conjunction with hands-on experience in machine learning, predictive analytics, and AI. My skill set runs deep in time series analysis, predictive modeling, image segmentation, and unsupervised learning techniques, including cluster analysis, using Python, R, SQL, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I also have deep knowledge of cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Azure, applied in scalable data processing and model deployment.

Throughout my career, in various roles in different industries, I learned the art of empowering actionable insights through data. I ensure that any solution is technically viable and can be scaled. For example, large-scale datasets were used for implementing demand forecasting and anomaly detection; optimization of data processing pipelines was performed, and unique challenges of data were modeled with custom models. My goal is to make sure meaningful, strategic outcomes are driven with data.

 Outside of coding, I enjoy problem-solving activities like Sudoku and crosswords that help develop my logical reasoning. I also enjoy staying active through sports and hiking, and I really like the competitive and team aspects eSports brings. I am excited about continuing my career in data science by developing impactful solutions, ones that will move not only this field forward but create real value out in the world.`;
